      <h3>Greetings!</h3>
      <p>A native of Vienna, Austria, I waltzed my way to New York in 2005. I work as an animator, video designer and illustrator in theater, film and installation. My animation work draws on my interest and background in theater, puppetry and opera.</p>
      <p>I’ve been lead animator on a host of Broadway shows, including <cite>Motown: the Musical</cite>, <cite>Jekyll & Hyde</cite>, <cite>Bring it On</cite>, and Shakespeare’s <cite>Macbeth</cite> at Lincoln Center Theater. I’ve also done animation work for <cite>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</cite>, the National Tour, as well as Ringling Brothers’ <cite>LEGENDS</cite> Tour and Disney’s <cite>Aladdin</cite> on Broadway.</p>
      <p>International credits include <cite>Cinderella</cite> for the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam, and <cite>A Winter’s Tale</cite> for the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden.</p>
      <p>In addition to theater I’ve done stage graphics and and internet branding for various festivals including Bonnaroo, Googa Mooga, and Kanye West’s set at Lollapalooza, Santiago.</p>
      <p>In New York I’ve worked, among other studios, at Transistor, MTV, Sesame Workshop, Little Airplane Productions, and in London with the BBC and Blink Productions.</p>
